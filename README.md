TicketMaster
Repository Description
Welcome to TicketMaster, a one-stop solution for buying, selling, and trading any kind of tickets online. This repository houses the source code for our comprehensive ticketing application. Our application simplifies the process of ticket management, allowing users to securely and efficiently carry out transactions over an intuitive user interface.

The application is built on a robust stack with Node.js at the backend and Next.js at the frontend, providing a seamless and high-performance user experience. The backend utilizes a Microservices Architecture for better scalability, maintainability, and agility. This approach allows us to develop and deploy services independently, ensuring minimal downtime, and enabling continuous delivery and deployment.

The structure of the project is as follows:

Frontend: The frontend is crafted with Next.js, a powerful React framework, and styled with modern CSS frameworks for a responsive and interactive UI. It's structured to provide a smooth user experience, allowing ticket buyers and sellers to navigate the ticketing process effortlessly.

Backend: The backend is built using Node.js, providing a non-blocking event-driven architecture for high efficiency and throughput. It follows the Microservices Architecture where each service is built around a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Database: The services interact with a database designed to provide robust transaction capabilities and secure data storage.

APIs: The application provides well-documented APIs that facilitate easy integration with other services.

Authentication: Security is a top priority. The application employs robust authentication and authorization to ensure that user data remains secure.

Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for more details about how to set up and run the various parts of the application.
